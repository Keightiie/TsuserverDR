    A mutable data type for player groups.

    WARNING: Mutable methods in this class do not perform internal structural checks after
    completion. Only use this class if you intend to develop a class that inherits from this class.

    Player groups are groups of users (called players) with an ID, where some players
    (possibly none) are leaders.

    Each player group may have a player limit (beyond which no new players may be added), may
    require that it never loses all its players as soon as it gets its first one (or else it
    is automatically deleted) and may require that if it has at least one player, then that
    there is at least one leader (or else one is automatically chosen between all players).
    Each of these groups may also impose a concurrent player membership limit, so that every user
    that is a player of it is at most a player of that many player groups managed by this
    group's manager.

    Once a group is scheduled for deletion, its manager will no longer recognize it as a group
    it is managing (it will unmanage it), so no further mutator public method calls would be
    allowed on the player group.

    """

    # (Private) Attributes
    # --------------------
    # _server : TsuserverDR
    #     Server the player group belongs to.
    # _manager : PlayerGroupManager
    #     Manager for this player group.
    # _playergroup_id : str
    #     Identifier for this player group.
    # _player_limit : int or None.
    #     If an int, it is the maximum number of players the group supports. If None, the group
    #     may have an arbitrary number of players.
    # _player_concurrent_limit : int or None.
    #     If an int, it is the maximum number of player groups managed by the same manager as
    #     this group that any player part of this player group may belong to, including this
    #     player group. If None, no such restriction is considered.
    # _players : set of ClientManager.Client
    #     Players of the player group.
    # _leaders : set of ClientManager.Client
    #     Leaders of the player group.
    # _invitations : set of clientManager.Client
    #     Users invited to (but not part of of) the player group.
    # _require_players : bool
    #     If True, the group will disassemble automatically if it loses all its players (but it
    #     may start with no players).
    # _require_leaders : bool
    #     If True and the group has no leaders but at least one player, it will randomly choose
    #     one player to be a leader.
    # _ever_had_players : bool
    #    If True, at least once has a player been added successfully the the player group;
    #    otherwise False.
    # _unmanaged : bool
    #     If True, the manager this group claims is its manager no longer recognizes it is
    #     managing this group, thus no further mutator public method calls would be allowed.

    # Invariants
    # ----------
    # 1. Each player is a client of the server.
    # 2. `self._unmanaged` is False if and only if `self` is in
    #    `self.manager.get_managees()`.
    # 3. If `self._unmanaged`, then `self._players`, `self._invitations`, `self._leaders` are
    #    all empty sets.
    # 4. For every player `player` in `self._players`, `self.manager.get_managees_of_user()[player]`
    #    exists and contains `self`.
    # 5. If `self._player_limit` is not None, then `len(self._players) <= player_limit`.
    # 6. For every player in `self._leaders`, they also belong in `self._players`.
    # 7. If `len(self._players) >= 1`, then `self._ever_had_players is True`.
    # 8. If `self._require_players` is True, then `len(self._players) >= 1 or self._unmanaged`.
    # 9. If `self._require_leaders` is True and `len(self._players) >= 1`, then
    #    `len(self._leaders) >= 1`.
    # 10. `self._invitations` and `self._players` are disjoint sets.
    # 11. If `self._require_invitations` is False, then `self._invitations` is the empty set.

        creator : ClientManager.Client, optional
            The player who created this group. If set, they will also be added to the group.
            Defaults to None.
        player_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of players the player group supports. If None, it
            indicates the player group has no player limit. Defaults to None.
        player_concurrent_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of player groups managed by `self` that any player
            of this group to create may belong to, including this group to create. If None, it

        require_invitations : bool, optional
            If True, users can only be added to the group if they were previously invited. If
            False, no checking for invitations is performed. Defaults to False.
        require_players : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the group loses all its players, the group will automatically
            be deleted. If False, no such automatic deletion will happen. Defaults to True.
        require_leaders : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the group has no leaders left, the group will choose a leader
            among any remaining players left; if no players are left, the next player added will
            be made leader. If False, no such automatic assignment will happen. Defaults to True.

        Create a new player group managed by this manager.

        Parameters
        ----------
        managee_type : Type[_PlayerGroup]
            Class of player group that will be produced. Defaults to None (and converted to the
            default player group created by this player group manager).
        creator : ClientManager.Client, optional
            The player who created this group. If set, they will also be added to the group.
            Defaults to None.
        player_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of players the player group supports. If None, it
            indicates the player group has no player limit. Defaults to None.
        player_concurrent_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of player groups managed by `self` that any player
            of this group to create may belong to, including this group to create. If None, it
            indicates that this group does not care about how many other player groups managed by
            `self` each of its players belongs to. Defaults to 1 (a player may not be in
            another group managed by `self` while in this new group).
        require_invitations : bool, optional
            If True, users can only be added to the group if they were previously invited. If
            False, no checking for invitations is performed. Defaults to False.
        require_players : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the group loses all its players, the group will automatically
            be deleted. If False, no such automatic deletion will happen. Defaults to True.
        require_leaders : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the group has no leaders left, the group will choose a leader
            among any remaining players left; if no players are left, the next player added will
            be made leader. If False, no such automatic assignment will happen. Defaults to True.
        **kwargs : Any
            Additional arguments to consider when producing the player group.

        -------
        _PlayerGroup

            If the manager is already managing its maximum number of groups.
        PlayerGroupError.UserHitGroupConcurrentLimitError.
