    A game with areas is a game that manages and subscribes to its areas' updates.
    Any player of such a game must be in an area of the game. If a player of the game goes to an
    area not part of the game, they are removed automatically from the game. If an area is removed
    from the set of areas of the game, all players in that area are removed in some unspecified
    order.
    Each of these games may also impose a concurrent area membership limit, so that every area
    part of a game with areas is at most an area of that many games with areas managed by this
    games's manager.
    Each of these games may also set an autoadd on client enter flag. If set, nonplayer clients
    who enter an area part of the game will be added to the game if possible; if this fails,
    no action is taken and no errors are propagated.

    Attributes
    ----------
    listener : Listener
        Standard listener of the game.

    Callback Methods
    ----------------
    _on_area_client_left_final
        Method to perform once a client left an area of the game.
    _on_area_client_entered_final
        Method to perform once a client entered an area of the game.
    _on_area_destroyed
        Method to perform once an area of the game is marked for destruction.
    _on_client_inbound_ms_check
        Method to perform once a player of the game wants to send an IC message.
    _on_client_inbound_ms_final
        Method to perform once a player of the game sends an IC message.
    _on_client_change_character
        Method to perform once a player of the game has changed character.
    _on_client_destroyed
        Method to perform once a player of the game is destroyed.

        Create a new game. A game should not be fully initialized anywhere else other than
        some manager code, as otherwise the manager will not recognize the game.

        Parameters
        ----------
        server : TsuserverDR
            Server the game belongs to.
        manager : GameManager
            Manager for this game.
        game_id : str
            Identifier of the game.
        player_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of players the game supports. If None, it
            indicates the game has no player limit. Defaults to None.
        player_concurrent_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of games managed by `manager` that any
            player of this game may belong to, including this game. If None, it indicates
            that this game does not care about how many other games managed by `manager` each
            of its players belongs to. Defaults to None.
        require_invitation : bool, optional
            If True, players can only be added to the game if they were previously invited. If
            False, no checking for invitations is performed. Defaults to False.
        require_players : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the game has no players left, the game will
            automatically be deleted. If False, no such automatic deletion will happen.
            Defaults to True.
        require_leaders : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the game has no leaders left, the game will choose a
            leader among any remaining players left; if no players are left, the next player
            added will be made leader. If False, no such automatic assignment will happen.
            Defaults to True.
        require_character : bool, optional
            If False, players without a character will not be allowed to join the game, and players
            that switch to something other than a character will be automatically removed from the
            game. If False, no such checks are made. A player without a character is considered
            one where player.has_character() returns False. Defaults to False.
        team_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of teams the game supports. If None, it
            indicates the game has no team limit. Defaults to None.
        timer_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of timers the game supports. If None, it
            indicates the game has no timer limit. Defaults to None.
        area_concurrent_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of games with areas managed by `manager` that any
            area of this game may belong to, including this game. If None, it indicates
            that this game does not care about how many other game with areas managed by
            `manager` each of its areas belongs to. Defaults to 1 (an area may not be a part of
            another game managed by `manager` while being an area of this game).
        autoadd_on_client_enter : bool, optional
            If True, nonplayer users that enter an area part of the game will be automatically
            added if permitted by the conditions of the game. If False, no such adding will take
            place. Defaults to False.
        playergroup_manager : PlayerGroupManager, optional
            The internal playergroup manager of the game manager. Access to this value is
            limited exclusively to this __init__, and is only to initialize the internal
            player group of the game.

        autoadd_on_client_enter : bool, optional
