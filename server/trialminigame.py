        Parameters
        ----------
        server : TsuserverDR
            Server the trial minigame belongs to.
        manager : GameManager
            Manager for this trial minigame.
        minigame_id : str
            Identifier of the trial minigame.
        player_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of players the trial minigame supports. If None, it
            indicates the trial minigame has no player limit. Defaults to None.
        player_concurrent_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of games managed by `manager` that any
            player of this trial minigame may belong to, including this trial minigame. If None, it
            indicates that this trial minigame does not care about how many other games managed by
            `manager` each of its players belongs to. Defaults to None.
        require_invitation : bool, optional
            If True, players can only be added to the trial minigame if they were previously
            invited. If False, no checking for invitations is performed. Defaults to False.
        require_players : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the trial minigame has no players left, the trial minigame will
            automatically be deleted. If False, no such automatic deletion will happen.
            Defaults to True.
        require_leaders : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the trial minigame has no leaders left, the trial minigame will
            choose a leader among any remaining players left; if no players are left, the next
            player added will be made leader. If False, no such automatic assignment will happen.
            Defaults to True.
        require_character : bool, optional
            If False, players without a character will not be allowed to join the trial minigame,
            and players that switch to something other than a character will be automatically
            removed from the trial minigame. If False, no such checks are made. A player without a
            character is considered one where player.has_character() returns False. Defaults to
            False.
        team_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of teams the trial minigame supports. If None, it
            indicates the trial minigame has no team limit. Defaults to None.
        timer_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of timers the trial minigame supports. If None,
            it indicates the trial minigame has no timer limit. Defaults to None.
        area_concurrent_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of trials managed by `manager` that any
            area of this trial may belong to, including this trial. If None, it indicates
            that this game does not care about how many other trials managed by
            `manager` each of its areas belongs to. Defaults to 1 (an area may not be a part of
            another trial managed by `manager` while being an area of this trial).
        autoadd_on_client_enter : bool, optional
            If True, nonplayer users that enter an area part of the game will be automatically
            added if permitted by the conditions of the game. If False, no such adding will take
            place. Defaults to False.
        trial : TrialManager.Trial, optional
            Trial the non-stop debate is a part of.
        autoadd_on_trial_player_add : bool, optional
            If True, players that are added to the trial will be automatically added if permitted
            by the conditions of the game. If False, no such adding will take place. Defaults to
            False.
        playergroup_manager : PlayerGroupManager, optional
            The internal playergroup manager of the game manager. Access to this value is
