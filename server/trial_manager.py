        Parameters
        ----------
        server : TsuserverDR
            Server the trial belongs to.
        manager : TrialManager
            Manager for this trial.
        trial_id : str
            Identifier of the trial.
        player_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of players the trial supports. If None, it
            indicates the trial has no player limit. Defaults to None.
        player_concurrent_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of trials managed by `manager` that any
            player of this trial may belong to, including this trial. If None, it indicates
            that this trial does not care about how many other trials managed by `manager` each
            of its players belongs to. Defaults to None.
        require_invitation : bool, optional
            If True, players can only be added to the trial if they were previously invited. If
            False, no checking for invitations is performed. Defaults to False.
        require_players : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the trial has no players left, the trial will
            automatically be deleted. If False, no such automatic deletion will happen.
            Defaults to True.
        require_leaders : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the trial has no leaders left, the trial will choose a
            leader among any remaining players left; if no players are left, the next player
            added will be made leader. If False, no such automatic assignment will happen.
            Defaults to True.
        require_character : bool, optional
            If False, players without a character will not be allowed to join the trial, and
            players that switch to something other than a character will be automatically
            removed from the trial. If False, no such checks are made. A player without a
            character is considered one where player.has_character() returns False. Defaults
            to False.
        team_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of teams the trial supports. If None, it
            indicates the trial has no team limit. Defaults to None.
        timer_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of timers the trial supports. If None, it
            indicates the trial has no timer limit. Defaults to None.
        area_concurrent_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of trials managed by `manager` that any
            area of this trial may belong to, including this trial. If None, it indicates
            that this game does not care about how many other trials managed by
            `manager` each of its areas belongs to. Defaults to 1 (an area may not be a part of
            another trial managed by `manager` while being an area of this trial).
        autoadd_on_client_enter : bool, optional
            If True, nonplayer users that enter an area part of the game will be automatically
            added if permitted by the conditions of the game. If False, no such adding will take
            place. Defaults to False.
        autoadd_minigame_on_player_added: bool, optional
            If True, any player added to the trial will be automatically added as a player of the
            latest minigame currently open in the trial. If no such minigame is open or the
            player addition fails, no action is taken. If False, no such adding will take place.
            Defaults to False.
        minigame_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of minigames the trial may have simultaneously.
            If None, it indicates the trial has no minigame limit. Defaults to 1.
        playergroup_manager : PlayerGroupManager, optional
            The internal playergroup manager of the trial manager. Access to this value is

            If an int, it is the maximum number of players the NSD supports. If None, it
            indicates the NSD has no player limit. Defaults to None.
        require_invitations : bool, optional
            If True, users can only be added to the NSD if they were previously invited. If
            False, no checking for invitations is performed. Defaults to False.
        require_players : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the NSD loses all its players, the NSD will automatically
            be deleted. If False, no such automatic deletion will happen. Defaults to True.
        require_character : bool, optional
            If False, players without a character will not be allowed to join the NSD, and
            players that switch to something other than a character will be automatically
            removed from the NSD. If False, no such checks are made. A player without a
            character is considered one where player.has_character() returns False. Defaults
            to False.
        team_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of teams the NSD will support. If None, it
            indicates the NSD will have no team limit. Defaults to None.
        autoadd_on_trial_player_add : bool, optional
            If True, players that are added to the trial will be automatically added if permitted
            by the conditions of the game. If False, no such adding will take place. Defaults to
            None (use self.autoadd_minigame_on_player_added).
        timer_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of timers the NSD will support. If None, it
            indicates the NSD will have no timer limit. Defaults to None.
        timer_start_value : float, optional
            In seconds, the length of time the main timer of this non-stop debate will have at the
            start. It must be a positive number. Defaults to 300 (5 minutes).

        Parameters
        ----------
        creator : ClientManager.Client, optional
            The player who created this trial. If set, they will also be added to the trial.
            Defaults to None.
        player_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of players the trial supports. If None, it
            indicates the trial has no player limit. Defaults to None.
        require_invitations : bool, optional
            If True, users can only be added to the trial if they were previously invited. If
            False, no checking for invitations is performed. Defaults to False.
        require_players : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the trial loses all its players, the trial will automatically
            be deleted. If False, no such automatic deletion will happen. Defaults to True.
        require_character : bool, optional
            If False, players without a character will not be allowed to join the trial, and
            players that switch to something other than a character will be automatically
            removed from the trial. If False, no such checks are made. A player without a
            character is considered one where player.has_character() returns False. Defaults
            to False.
        team_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of teams the trial will support. If None, it
            indicates the trial will have no team limit. Defaults to None.
        timer_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of timers the trial will support. If None, it
            indicates the trial will have no timer limit. Defaults to None.
        area_concurrent_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of trials managed by `manager` that any
            area of the created trial may belong to, including the created trial. If None, it
            indicates that this trial does not care about how many other trials managed by
            `manager` each of its areas belongs to. Defaults to 1 (an area may not be a part of
            another trial managed by `manager` while being an area of this trials).
        autoadd_on_client_enter : bool, optional
            If True, nonplayer users that enter an area part of the game will be automatically
            added if permitted by the conditions of the game. If False, no such adding will take
            place. Defaults to False.
        autoadd_minigame_on_player_added : bool, optional
            If True, nonplayer users that are added to the trial will also be automatically added
            to the minigame if permitted by its conditions. If False, no such adding will take
            place. Defaults to False.
