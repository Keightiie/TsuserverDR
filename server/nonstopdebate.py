        Create a new nonstop debate (NSD) game. An NSD should not be fully initialized anywhere
        else other than some manager code, as otherwise the manager will not recognize the NSD.

        Parameters
        ----------
        server : TsuserverDR
            Server the NSD belongs to.
        manager : GameManager
            Manager for this NSD.
        NSD_id : str
            Identifier of the NSD.
        player_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of players the NSD supports. If None, it
            indicates the NSD has no player limit. Defaults to None.
        player_concurrent_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of games managed by `manager` that any
            player of this NSD may belong to, including this NSD. If None, it indicates
            that this NSD does not care about how many other games managed by `manager` each
            of its players belongs to. Defaults to None.
        require_invitation : bool, optional
            If True, players can only be added to the NSD if they were previously invited. If
            False, no checking for invitations is performed. Defaults to False.
        require_players : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the NSD has no players left, the NSD will
            automatically be deleted. If False, no such automatic deletion will happen.
            Defaults to True.
        require_leaders : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the NSD has no leaders left, the NSD will choose a
            leader among any remaining players left; if no players are left, the next player
            added will be made leader. If False, no such automatic assignment will happen.
            Defaults to True.
        require_character : bool, optional
            If False, players without a character will not be allowed to join the NSD, and players
            that switch to something other than a character will be automatically removed from the
            NSD. If False, no such checks are made. A player without a character is considered
            one where player.has_character() returns False. Defaults to False.
        team_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of teams the NSD supports. If None, it
            indicates the NSD has no team limit. Defaults to None.
        timer_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of timers the NSD supports. If None, it
            indicates the NSD has no timer limit. Defaults to None.
        areas : set of AreaManager.Area, optional
            Areas the NSD starts with. Defaults to None.
        area_concurrent_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of trials managed by `manager` that any
            area of this trial may belong to, including this trial. If None, it indicates
            that this game does not care about how many other trials managed by
            `manager` each of its areas belongs to. Defaults to 1 (an area may not be a part of
            another trial managed by `manager` while being an area of this trial).
        autoadd_on_client_enter : bool, optional
            If True, nonplayer users that enter an area part of the game will be automatically
            added if permitted by the conditions of the game. If False, no such adding will take
            place. Defaults to False.
        trial : TrialManager.Trial, optional
            Trial the nonstop debate is a part of. Defaults to None.
        timer_start_value : float, optional
            In seconds, the length of time the main timer of this nonstop debate will have at the
            start. It must be a positive number. Defaults to 300 (5 minutes).
        autoadd_on_trial_player_add : bool, optional
            If True, players that are added to the trial will be automatically added if permitted
            by the conditions of the game. If False, no such adding will take place. Defaults to
            False.
        playergroup_manager : PlayerGroupManager, optional
            The internal playergroup manager of the game manager. Access to this value is
            limited exclusively to this __init__, and is only to initialize the internal
            player group of the NSD.

        Raises
        ------
        GameError.ManagerTooManyGamesError
            If the manager is already managing its maximum number of NSDs.
